# Cab-Booking-Flutter-Web-App
Cab Booking Template - Flutter

Cab offers you just about everything you are looking for in a free taxi service website template. Almost, too obvious, don’t you think? But you know the gist of it; keeping things simple and to the point is one of the best approaches to succeed online.

With Taxi, you bring your transportation services front and center, and that is what matters most. On top of that, above the fold, you will find a sophisticated and advanced booking form with a date and time picker. What’s more, Taxi gives you a chance to introduce yourself, why you are the best taxi business in town and how they can benefit from you. Of course, do not forget to add a personal touch to your online experience and they will love to return to book another ride.
